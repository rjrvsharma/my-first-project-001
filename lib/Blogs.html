            <h2>GET</h2>

            <p>GET requests are the most common and widely used methods in APIs and websites. Simply put, the GET method
                is used to retreive data from a server at the specified resource. For example, say you have an API with
                a /users endpoint. Making a GET request to that endpoint should return a list of all available users.

                Since a GET request is only requesting data and not modifying any resources, it's considered a safe and
                idempotent method.</p>

            <h2>Testing an API with GET requests.</h2>

            <p> When you're creating tests for an API, the GET method will likely be the most frequent type of request
                made by consumers of the service, so it's important to check every known endpoint with a GET request.

                At a basic level, these things should be validated:

                Check that a valid GET request returns a 200 status code.
                Ensure that a GET request to a specific resource returns the correct data. For example, GET /users
                returns a list of users.
                GET is often the default method in HTTP clients, so creating tests for these resources should be simple
                with any tool you choose.</p>

                <h1>POST</h1>
                <p>In web services, POST requests are used to send data to the API server to create or udpate a
                    resource. The data sent to the server is stored in the request body of the HTTP request.

                    The simplest example is a contact form on a website. When you fill out the inputs in a form and hit
                    Send, that data is put in the response body of the request and sent to the server. This may be JSON,
                    XML, or query parameters (there's plenty of other formats, but these are the most common).

                    It's worth noting that a POST request is non-idempotent. It mutates data on the backend server (by
                    creating or updating a resource), as opposed to a GET request which does not change any data. Here
                    is a great explanation of idempotentcy.</p>
                <h2>Testing an API with POST requests</h2>
                <p>The second most common HTTP method you'll encounter in your API tests is POST. As mentioned above,
                    POST requests are used to send data to the API server and create or update a resource. Since POST
                    requests modify data, it's important to have API tests for all of your POST methods.

                    Here are some tips for testing POST requests:

                    Create a resource with a POST request and ensure a 200 status code is returned.
                    Next, make a GET request for that resource, and ensure the data was saved correctly.
                    Add tests that ensure POST requests fail with incorrect or ill-formatted data.</p>

            <h2>About Status CodesT</h2>

            <p>Every time you click on a link or type in a URL and press Enter, your browser sends a request to the
                webserver for the site you’re trying to access. The server receives and processes the request, and then
                sends back the relevant resources along with an HTTP header.

                HTTP status codes are delivered to your browser in the HTTP header. While status codes are returned
                every single time your browser requests a web page or resource, most of the time you don’t see them.

                It’s usually only when something goes wrong that you might see one displayed in your browser. This is
                the server’s way of saying: “Something isn’t right. Here’s a code that explains what went wrong.”</p>

            <h2>Understanding HTTP Status Code Classes.</h2>

            <p>HTTP status codes are divided into 5 “classes”. These are groupings of responses that have similar or
                related meanings. Knowing what they are can help you quickly determine the general substance of a status

                code before you go about looking up its specific meaning.
                <h3>The five classes include:<h/3>
